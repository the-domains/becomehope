BECOME: Biblically Equipped Community On Mission Everywhere New Hope Church seeks to BECOME a Biblically Equipped Community On Mission Everywhere: Biblically Equipped We want to be in meaningful relationship with God, maturing in our faith each and every day. That is why we provide opportunities to BECOME biblically equipped through our Sunday morning teaching, Sunday adult classes, Hope Groups, age-graded ministries, and various training opportunities. "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength." (Mark 12:30) Community We want to be in meaningful relationships with each other according to God's design. Therefore, we provide opportunities to find community through Hope Groups, church-wide gatherings, and a variety of ministry teams. "So in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others." (Romans 12:5) On Mission Everywhere We believe that the church exists for those outside our walls. We encourage and provide opportunities for people to BECOME On Mission Everywhere, realizing that our neighbors, coworkers, and family are our very own mission field.  Some expressions of New Hope being on mission are our Nicaragua missions, STARS tutoring ministry, Vacation Bible School, and Children of Hope Preschool. "Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you." (Matthew 28:19-20) To BECOME in a God-honoring way requires us to keep God at the center of all we do. Only through His presence and leading in our lives can we see our vision BECOME a reality. We desire to be a part of something so big that it is destined to fail without God. "Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen." (Ephesians 3:20-21)
