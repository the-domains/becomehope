What Should I Expect? First, let us just say what we expect from you when you visit for the first time. We expect you to be yourself. We expect you to be our guest and to let us serve you. We will not expect you to be singled out, speak or pray out loud or raise a hand, give your money, sign up for the daily newsletter, sign a covenant, and honestly...you don't even have to sing real loud if you don't want to. We expect you to come and check us out, not jump in with both feet until you're sure it's a good fit. Sundays are a great time around New Hope. Our focus is to learn more about Jesus, his plan for our lives, and how we can join his work in this world. We utilize practical teaching from the Bible and modern worship music with guitars and drums. You'll find exciting age-graded opportunities for the whole family. We have identical gatherings at both 9:00 am and 10:30 am for children and adults. (Be sure and check out the Middle School and High School pages to see what they are up to currently.) We are just a group of people on a journey to BECOME more like Jesus. We laugh a lot, we don't have it all together, but we are passionate about living out God's love.
